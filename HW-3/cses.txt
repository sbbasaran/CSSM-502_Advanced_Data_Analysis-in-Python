COLLABORATOR INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CSES QUESTIONNAIRE:

  ( 1)  Following these collaborator instructions, this document is 
        comprised of three sections:

        ))) CSES MODULE 4 QUESTIONNAIRE: ADMINISTRATIVE VARIABLES

        The "Administrative Variables" section is a list of common
        administrative variables that, if possible, should be provided at
        the time data are deposited with the CSES Secretariat.

        ))) CSES MODULE 4 QUESTIONNAIRE: CSES MODULE

        This is the CSES Module itself, a common module of survey questions
        for researchers to include in their national post-election survey.
        The CSES Module is intended to be administered exactly as it is
        specified in this document.

        ))) CSES MODULE 4 QUESTIONNAIRE: DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES

        Collaborators are asked to provide data on background (demographic)
        characteristics of respondents, coded to an agreed upon set of
        standards as indicated in this section. There is great
        international variation in the ways that collaborators will go
        about soliciting information on the background characteristics of
        their respondents. The objective here is not standardization of the
        way collaborators ask these background questions, but instead,
        standardization to a common, cross-national scheme for coding each
        variable.

  ( 2)  The CSES Module is intended to be administered in its entirety as
        a single, uninterrupted block of questions, unless noted otherwise
        for particular questions. In most cases, the CSES Module is 
        included as part of a larger study. For reliable comparisons to be
        made, it is important that any additional items investigators may
        wish to include do not interrupt the CSES Module.

  ( 3)  The CSES module should be administered as a post-election
        interview.

  ( 4)  Where the CSES module is included in a larger study, to ensure that
        question-ordering effects are minimized, it is most preferable for
        the CSES Module to be administered at the beginning of the survey
        instrument. Where this is not possible, collaborators should be
        sensitive to the effects questions asked immediately prior to the
        module may have.

  ( 5)  NOTES often precede the question TEXT, and provide instructions for
        the administration of the item. Where no question TEXT is provided,
        collaborators should provide documentation of the question used.

  ( 6)  Showcards may be helpful for the administration of some questions.
        For this reason, a Respondent Booklet is available for download
        from the CSES website. The Respondent Booklet contains showcards
        for select questions. It is indicated in the NOTES when a showcard
        is available for a question.
        
  ( 7)  The response options that should be read to the respondent are
        contained in the body of the question TEXT.

  ( 8)  Where lower-case words appear in brackets [ ] collaborators should
        select the words that are most appropriate.

        For example:
        [party/presidential candidate]
        ...indicates that either the word "party" or the phrase
        "presidential candidate" should be read, but not both.

  ( 9)  Where upper-case words appear in brackets [ ] collaborators should
        substitute the words that are most appropriate.

        For example:
        [COUNTRY]
        ...should be replaced with the name of the country where the
        election was held (perhaps "Canada" or "the Philippines").

        Another example:
        [NUMBER OF YEARS BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS AND THE PRESENT ELECTION
        OR CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT]
        ...should be replaced with a number that indicates the amount of
        years that have passed between the previous election and either the
        current election or recent change in government.

  (10)  Phrases that appear in parentheses ( ) contain words that are
        optional - that collaborators (or their interviewers) can decide to
        read or not read to respondents as needed.

  (11)  Words in question text that are in upper-case but NOT within 
        brackets [ ] should be emphasized by the interviewer when reading
        the question text. 
        
        For example, the word "COUNTRY" would be emphasized in the
        following question when the interviewer reads the question to the
        respondent:
        
        What COUNTRY do you live in?
        
        But in this next example, the interviewer does not emphasize the
        word "[COUNTRY]". Instead, this is an instruction for the
        collaborator to substitute the name of the respondent's country
        into the question text (for more information, see the eighth
        Collaborator Instruction above):
        
        How long have you lived in [COUNTRY]?
                        
  (12)  Interviewer instructions are available for some questions. These
        interviewer instructions, labeled as HELP, are intended to
        provide advice to the interviewers to assist in administering the
        question. It is also useful to discuss the interviewer instructions
        as part of interviewer training. The interviewer instructions, 
        where available, appear after the question TEXT. In 
        interviewer-administered surveys, interviewer instructions should
        be available to the interviewer, but not to the respondent. For
        example, in a computer-assisted interview, the interviewer
        instructions might appear on the screen in a special color, and
        interviewers trained to make use of those instructions as
        necessary, but the interviewer should NOT read the interviewer
        instructions to the respondent.
        
  (13)  Some response options are followed by an arrow (->) and a skip
        pattern instruction. If the respondent selects that response 
        option, the skip pattern instruction after the arrow is to be
        executed.

  (14)  Respondents who volunteer the response "DON'T KNOW" (or who have
        REFUSED to answer a question) should be coded as such. Interviewers
        should accept these responses and should NOT probe for additional
        information or force a respondent to use one of the response
        options provided in the text of the question.

  (15)  Special care should be taken in the administration of the Vote 
        Choice items (Q5 and Q6 question series).
        
        Wording for the Q5 and Q6 question series, which is to record
        vote choice in the elections, should follow national standards. 
       
        Collaborators are invited to compare their own national instrument
        with other instruments of countries that are part of the CSES and
        look for convergence where this is possible.
        
        For Q6 (previous election), ask about the previous national 
        election of the same type (whether legislative or presidential).
        For countries where more than one institution is being currently
        elected on the same day (e.g. president and legislature), please 
        consider asking about the previous lower house election if votes
        have been recorded for the current lower house election. 
        
        For Q5 (current election), for countries where more than one 
        institution is elected on the same day (e.g., president and 
        legislature) using different votes, please ensure that all votes
        are supplied. Consider including all national elections having been
        held within three months before or after the study's data 
        collection period.
        
        Please ensure all vote choices are supplied as separate variables
        in the dataset that you deposit.
        
        For countries where voters have two votes for the same institution
        (e.g. parallel and mixed member proportional systems; double
        ballot systems), please ensure that both/all votes are supplied.
        
        For countries using preferential systems (e.g., STV, AV) please
        provide first and second preference vote.
          
  (16)  For questions asking about parties, collaborators should be advised
        that they may add one or several party blocs to a list of
        individual parties if they feel that it will be difficult for
        respondents to recognize individual parties.

  (17)  Collaborators in the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems shall
        adhere to the following standards of data quality:

        a. Mode of interviewing: Interviews should be conducted
           face-to-face, unless local circumstances dictate that telephone
           or mail surveys will produce higher quality data.

        b. Timing of interviewing: We strongly recommend that collaborators
           in the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems conduct their
           interviews in the weeks following their national election. Out
           of concern for data quality, data collection should be completed
           in as timely a fashion as possible. In the event of a runoff
           election, interviewing shall be conducted after the first round
           election. The date of interview shall be provided for each
           respondent.

        c. Placement of module in post-election questionnaire: The
           questionnaire module should be asked as a single, uninterrupted
           block of questions. We leave it to each collaborator to select
           an appropriate location for the module in their national survey
           instrument. Collaborators should take steps to ensure that
           questions asked immediately prior to the questionnaire module
           do not contaminate the initial questions in the module.
           Collaborators are also free to select an appropriate place in
           their survey instrument to ask the turnout, vote choice,
           and demographic questions.

        d. Population to be sampled: National samples should be drawn from
           all age-eligible citizens. When non-citizens (or other 
           non-eligible respondents) are included in the sample, a
           variable should be provided to permit the identification of
           those non-eligible respondents. When a collaborator samples from
           those persons who appear on voter registration lists, the
           collaborator should quantify the estimated degree of discrepancy
           between this population and the population of all age-eligible
           citizens.

        e. Sampling procedures: We strongly encourage the use of random
           samples, with random sampling procedures used at all stages of
           the sampling process. Collaborators should provide detailed
           documentation of their sampling practices.

        f. Sample Size: We strongly recommend that no fewer than 1,000
           age-eligible respondents be interviewed.

        g. Interviewer training: Collaborators should pre-test their survey
           instrument and should train interviewers in the administration
           of the questionnaire. The Planning Committee will provide each
           collaborator with documentation that clarifies the purposes and
           objectives of each item and with rules with respect to probing
           "don't know" responses.

        h. Field practices: Collaborators should make every effort to
           ensure a high response rate. Investigators should be diligent in
           their effort to reach respondents not interviewed on the initial
           contact with the household and should be diligent in their
           effort to convert respondents who initially refuse to
           participate in the study. Data on the number of contact
           attempts, the number of contacts with sample persons, and
           special persuasion or conversion efforts undertaken should be
           coded for each respondent.

        i. Strategies for translation (and back-translation): Each
           collaborator should translate the questionnaire module into
           their native language(s). To ensure the equivalence of the
           translation, collaborators shall perform an independent
           re-translation of the questionnaire back into English.
           Collaborators engaged in translation of the questionnaire module
           into the same language (e.g., Spanish, French, English, German,
           and Portuguese) should collaborate on the translation.

===========================================================================

NOTES:   This is the CSES Module itself, a common module of survey
         questions for researchers to include in their national
         post-election survey. The questionnaire is intended to be
         administered exactly as it appears in this document.

         All items in this section begin with the letter "Q".


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1a.     >>> PUBLIC EXPENDITURE: HEALTH
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:   The following definitions are provided as guidance for
         translating questions Q1a through Q1h into other languages.

         The word "health" is intended to refer to public expenditure
         related to health care, i.e., public health care programs, public
         hospitals, clinics, etc.

         The word "education" is intended to refer to public expenditure 
         related to all forms of education, i.e., primary and secondary 
         education, universities and colleges, etc.

         The phrase "unemployment benefits" is intended to refer to 
         public expenditure related to the unemployed, mainly through 
         employment insurance programs, but also job training directed at 
         the unemployed, and related programs.

         The word "defense" is intended to refer to public expenditure on 
         the military, and other defense-related programs; it is NOT 
         intended to refer to other international affairs programs, nor 
         foreign aid.

         The phrase "old-age pensions" is intended to refer to public
         expenditure on old age pensions, NOT other spending on programs
         directed at the elderly.

         The phrase "business and industry" is intended to refer to public
         expenditure related to helping business and industry, particularly
         through subsidies.

         The phrase "police and law enforcement" is intended to refer to
         public expenditure on the justice system related to police and
         law enforcement.

         The phrase "welfare benefits" is intended to refer to public
         expenditure on welfare programs or social benefit programs.
         ..................................................................

TEXT:    For the next questions, please say whether there should be more or
         less public expenditure in each of the following areas. Remember
         if you say "more" it could require a tax increase, and if you say
         "less" it could require a reduction in those services.

         Thinking about public expenditure on HEALTH, 
         should there be much more than now, somewhat more than now, 
         the same as now, somewhat less than now, or much less than now?

         If appropriate, the collaborator may also include up to three 
         additional parties [PARTY G through PARTY I] that are relevant to 
         studying the election, regardless of the number of votes received.

         It is important that interviewers properly record the volunteered 
         responses "don't know" and "haven't heard of" when respondents 
         offer either response.

         Also, a showcard is available for this question.

NOTES:   In most national contexts, the left-right dimension will be the

Q20a.    >>> POLITICAL INFORMATION ITEM - 1ST
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:   The items in question set Q20a-Q20d are designed to indicate the
         respondent's general political awareness. Their intent is to
         provide a combined general assessment of the respondent's
         attention to politics, more than of their knowledge or familiarity
         with specific aspects of politics. 

         For each question, please provide CSES the original question
         with the full response set, as provided to the respondent.
         Additionally, please let CSES know which answer is the "correct"
         answer out of the four choices provided to the respondent. In the
         variable provided to CSES, CSES wants to receive the actual answer
         that the respondent provided, not whether the answer was correct
         or not. If the order of the response codes was randomized, we
         would also appreciate receiving an additional variable indicating
         the randomization for each respondent.

         In Q20a, one name in the list should be the Finance Minister that
         was in office at the moment of the election. The three other
         names in the list should be three other high-profile Cabinet 
         Ministers in that previous government.

Q20b.    >>> POLITICAL INFORMATION ITEM - 2ND
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:   In the options, please list each of the unemployment rate choices 
         in the format "XX.X%" - for instance, 4.5% or 10.1%.

         After populating one of the options with the actual current
         unemployment rate in the country of your election study, please 
         then add or subtract 2.0% from that amount until the other three 
         options are populated with incorrect alternatives.
         
         Please list the options in increasing order.
         
         For instance, if the actual unemployment rate is 8.7%, any of 
         these example choice sets would be acceptable:
         
          2.7%,  4.7%,  6.7%,  8.7%
          4.7%,  6.7%,  8.7%, 10.7%
          6.7%,  8.7%, 10.7%, 12.7%
          8.7%, 10.7%, 12.7%, 14.7%

         Module.
         
         When depositing the election study with the CSES Secretariat, it
         would be helpful for the collaborator to let the CSES Secretariat 
         know the source of the unemployment rate used in the question.

         accommodate the aforementioned skip pattern, collaborators are 
         asked to please place this question somewhere after their question
         indicating the "current employment status" of the respondent's
         spouse/partner, a question which is normally included in the 
         demographics section of a questionnaire.

))) CSES MODULE 3 QUESTIONNAIRE: DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES 
===========================================================================

NOTES:    Collaborators are asked to provide data on background 
          (demographic) characteristics of respondents, coded to an agreed 
          upon set of standards as indicated in this section. 
          There is great international variation in the ways that 
          collaborators will go about soliciting information on the 
          background characteristics of their respondents. The 
          objective here is not standardization of the way collaborators
          ask these background questions, but instead, standardization to 
          a common, cross-national scheme for coding each variable.

D11.    >>> MAIN OCCUPATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:   This item should report the respondent's main occupation, that
         is, the job at which the respondent spends most of the time or
         if the respondent spends an equal amount of time on two jobs, it
         is the one from which the respondent earns the most money. For
         respondents who are currently employed, this variable reports
         their current occupation. For respondents who are retired or not
         currently working, code last occupation.
 
         Please classify respondents according to the three-digit version
         of the 2008 International Standard Classification of Occupations 
         (ISCO-08).

         An English-language description of the ISCO-08 standard can be
         found here:
         http://
         www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/docs/resol08.pdf

         While in past CSES modules a less detailed occupation code
         was used, occupation of both the respondent and their 
         spouse/partner is especially important to the substantive 
         theme of CSES Module 4. CSES Module 4 analyses will significantly
         benefit from coding of the occupation variables to three digits.     
         
         If the national collaborator team feels that providing the
         three digit ISCO-08 codes will cause important or serious issues
         with respect to the conduct of the survey, they should discuss 
         these issues with the CSES Secretariat in advance.

D16.     >>> SPOUSE/PARTNER: OCCUPATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:   This item should report the spouse/partner's main occupation, that
         is, the job at which the spouse/partner spends most of the time or
         if the spouse/partner spends an equal amount of time on two jobs,
         it is the one from which the spouse/partner earns the most money. 
         For spouses/partners who are currently employed, this variable
         reports their current occupation. For spouses/partners who are
         retired or not currently working, code last occupation.
 
         Please classify respondents according to the three-digit version
         of the 2008 International Standard Classification of Occupations 
         (ISCO-08).

         An English-language description of the ISCO-08 standard can be
         found here:
         http://
         www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/docs/resol08.pdf

         While in past CSES modules a less detailed occupation code
         was used, occupation of both the respondent and their 
         spouse/partner is especially important to the substantive 
         theme of CSES Module 4. CSES Module 4 analyses will significantly
         benefit from coding of the occupation variables to three digits.     
                 
         If the national collaborator team feels that providing the
         three digit ISCO-08 codes will cause important or serious issues
         with respect to the conduct of the survey, they should discuss 
         these issues with the CSES Secretariat in advance.

         differences (though some correspond to administrative regions) 
         that manifest themselves in political cleavages.
